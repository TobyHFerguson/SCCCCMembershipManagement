Hi {First},
<p>
here at Santa Cruz County Cycling Club we've migrated you from ClubExpress (our old platfom) to our new Google based platform. 
Your name, email, phone number, directory opt-in prefernce, joining date, membership term and membership expiration date and directory 
preference have all been used to create a record of you in the new system.
<table style="border-collapse: collapse;">
   <thead>
      <th style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: center;">Email</th>
      <th style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: center;">First</th>
      <th style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: center;">Last</th>

      <th style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: center;">Expires</th>
      <th style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: center;">Membership Term (years)</th>

      <tr>
         <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: center;">{Email}</td>
         <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: center;">{First}</td>
         <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: center;">{Last}</td>
         <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: center;">{Phone}</td>
         <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: center;">{Joined}</td>
         <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: center;">{Expires}</td>
         <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 8px; text-align: center;">{Period}</td>

<p>
The three critical features of this change are:
<ul>
<li>Our costs have dropped significantly - 50% of our income used to go to ClubExpress; its considerably less (closer to 0%!) with Google.</li>
<li>The website address has changed. Our new website  now at <a href="https://home.santacruzcountycycling.club">home.santacruzcountycycling.club</a></li>
<li>The Forums (and their email addresses) have been replaced by Google Groups</li>
</ul>
<p>
We will be keeping parts of the old ClubExpress site up for a little while until the dust has settled in our new home, but our goal is to get rid of it just as soon as is practical. 
(Note that we are unable to transfer the old forums data - who said what to whom, and when - so if there's anything critical in there then you should dive in and grab it
before we get ride of the old forums).
</p>
Your email address ({Email}) has been subscribed to several Google Groups. A key thing to watch out for is 
that our Groups fall into two types:
<dl>
<dt>Announcements</dt>
<dd>A group for one way communication from the club to its members</dd>
<dt>Discussions</dt>
<dd>A group for two way communication</dd>
<dl>
<p>
Please visit the <a href="https://home.santacruzcountycycling.club/member-resources#h.gu2yuyt1stn3">Groups</a> section of our new website for details of the groups and how they are to be used.
<p>
Overall this has little practical impact on any of our members except that the website address has changed, and the forums (and the addresses you will send and receive messages from) have changed too. 
<p>
With this new system the goal is for most people to survive without ever having to log in. We haven't yet implemented it but we will be implementing
 a <b>no-login-required</b> (yay!) mechanism to modify your membership data and your Google Group subscriptions. Further down the line we'll be using
that same mechanism to do online voting. Until we have that portion up and running 
please email the <a href="mailto:membership@santacruzcountycycling.club">Membership Director</a> and they will make the changes for you.
<p>
Meantime, if the email {Email} we have registered for you is a Google account (or if it becomes a Google Account because you choose to use your non-Google email to
<a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&oco=0">Create a Google Account</a>) 
then you can do some things (such as changing your Google Group subscriptions and settings) using Google's own tools in the usual Google way.  
<p>
This is most likely to apply to members who want to access the Google Groups directly, as opposed to relying on emails only.
<p>
If you have any issues then please don't hesitate to contact the <a href="mailto:membership@santacruzcountycycling.club">Membership Director</a>
