// Namespace initialization for services was moved to `src/0namespaces.js` to
// ensure the globals are created before service constants and other files run.
// This file is retained as a compatibility shim for environments that still
// reference it by path. It's intentionally a no-op to avoid redeclaring globals.

// No-op shim; see src/0namespaces.js for the canonical guarded namespace initializers.
